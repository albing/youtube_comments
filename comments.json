I mean, seriously—*this* is the straw to break the camel's back?\n\n\"I've heard loudly and clearly that Canadians want a better system of governance, a better system of choosing our governments, and I'm working very hard so that 2015 is indeed the last election under first-past-the-post\" \n\nThat was arguably the keystone of the Liberals' 2015 platform.  Masses of us voted for Trudeau as an organized strategic bloc in order to oust the tyrant Harper and ensure a future where such corruption could no longer run unchecked.  Upon winning the election, one of Trudeau's first actions was to try and tell us that there was no indication that the nation wanted a fair voting system.  We *strongly* advised him otherwise.  He gave us a bloody *web survey* (from SurveyMonkey, IIRC), brimming with trick questions and slippery wording,  We gave him all the correct answers, in droves.  So he simply threw all the evidence—and his promise, and the good of the nation, and the will of its people—out the window.\n\nAnd since then he's been handing out billions of dollars of corporate blowjobs right and left, interspersed with purely cosmetic 'progressive' legislation, photo ops, and an official Marvel comic book appearance in which he punches out Tony Stark.  That's right.  Our Hero Trudeau knocked out an imaginary superhero.  Yaaaaaay team Canada.\n\nI never want to see another Conservative majority government.  But I never want to see another majority Liberal government either.  Both parties need to die and make space for representatives that are not utterly corrupt and ethically spineless.",
