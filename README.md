# Youtube Comments Word Counter

> Counts words for you, so you don't have to.

### Info

Creates a lot of `savedata*.dat` files; use those for recovery, or delete them, see if I care.

The one you do want to save is results_<video_key>.dat - it's a json dump of the unadulterated words object.

### Requirements

There needs to be a key in `$API_KEY`.  Here's how to get one: [https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started]

I store mine in a file called `secrets` (see [secrets.example](secrets.example) ) and `source` it.

Also, there's a `requirements.txt` file to `pip install -r` after you've `python -m venv venv` -ed and `source venv/bin/activate` -ed.

### How To Run It

1. Set `$API_KEY` and edit `main.py` to change `video_id`

2. Run the script to download the comments

    `python main.py`

3. Clean up the mess it made

    `rm savedata*.dat`

4. Run the random walker

    `python walker.py results_<video_id>.dat <start_word>`
